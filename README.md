### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer from Ecuador ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¨

I love functional programming and Haskell in particular. I'm also obsessed with logs queues for some reason.

I'm currently working on my bachelor's thesis on distributed tracing.

I have a distributed systems group at my job where we meet online to read papers/books.
Also, we're currently going through Fly.io's gossip glomers. Feel free to reach out if you want to join!
