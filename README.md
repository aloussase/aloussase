### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer from Ecuador in love with functional programming and distributed systems.

I'm currently working on my bachelor's thesis on distributed tracing.

I have a distributed systems group at my job where we meet online to read papers/books. 
We are currently: 

- Reading "Database Design and Implementation"
- Going through Fly.io's [gossip glomers](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) 

Feel free to reach out if you want to join!
