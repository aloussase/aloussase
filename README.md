### Hi there 👋

I'm a programmer from Ecuador 🇪🇨 in love with distributed systems and compilers.

I'm currently working on my bachelor's thesis on distributed tracing.

I use Java ☕ as my main language, but consider myself a polyglot 😜.

#### Outside of working hours, I like to:

- 📖 Read
- 👨‍🍳 Cook
- 🗣️ Learn (human) languages (currently French + Portuguese)
- 🎸 Play bass
